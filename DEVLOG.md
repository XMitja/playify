# Dev Log

### 10.05.2020:

* Bug fixes in song fetching. Instead of fetching each song's artwork, only one of each for an album is fetched to use less RAM and improve speed.
* Added song queues, setting a queue, and playing a queue.
* Functionally working, but still needs improvements. 

#### 09.05.2020:

* Created the project.
* Added a native channel for iOS.
* Created Album, Artist, and Song classes.
* Added playing, pausing, getting song information and artwork, and fetching all songs from Apple Music using iOS's Media Player.
